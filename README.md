# [DearFriend](http://dearfriend.cc)

Receiving handwritten letters is much more awesome than emails.

Now you have a new way to send messages to special ones. The best part: you do it supporting people, groups and communities.

Dear Friends are handwritters. They give life to your email message transforming it into a letter, for the price of a cup of coffee.
